### Project Medbook

**Overview**: MedBook - Medbook streamlines patient management for healthcare professionals. It simplifies the process of accessing patients' contact information and medical records, making it easier for healthcare providers to efficiently coordinate care.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=ryanongwx&breakdown=false&sort=groupTitle%20dsc&sortWithin=title&since=2023-09-22&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos)

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Enhancement 1**: Search Patient v1.2

  - Broaden the scope of search such that it covers all the necessary information stored within all patients. This is to ensure that a doctor could search for any information on a patient when required. This is especially important in situations where doctors would like to search for all patients which have a certain condition or have a certain allergy.

* **New Feature 1**: Add Attach File Functionality v1.3
  - Allows doctors to attach a medical report documennt to a record. This allows efficient management of medical documents and allows doctors to keep track of their records in an organised manner.
  - Files would be stored in their local storage of the device. Upon attaching the file, they would be able to open the document whenever they require it.
  - This is extremely useful for attaching files such as blood test results that is vital to be kept together with patient records.

* **New Feature 2**: Add Encryption/Decryption Functionality v1.3
  - Encrypts data from the application using AES encryption such that the data in the addressbook.json file is encrypted.
  - This is to ensure privacy and confidentiality for patient data.
  - This functionality was later scrapped due to the group prject constraints


* **Bug Fixes**: Fixed all Bugs in repo for v1.2
  - [Link to Bug Fix](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/pull/40)
  - Prior to this all Java CI checks failed due to failing of testcases and some features not implemented correctly
  - Fixed wrong feature implementations wrote by teammates in addrecord, addpatient and pin patient commands.
  - Fixed all testcases such that all Java CI checks could pass in in addrecord, addpatient and pin patient commands.

* **Project management**:
  * Managed releases `v1.3` - `v1.5rc` (3 releases) on GitHub
  * Filmed and stitched the video demo together
  * Assessed testers' issues from PE-D

    - Added documentation for the all features that I had implemented
  * Developer Guide:
    - Added implementation details for the all features that I had implemented
